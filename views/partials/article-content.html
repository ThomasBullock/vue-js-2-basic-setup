    <p>WASHINGTON</p>
    <p>Gov. Jerry Brown was an intriguing early choice to command the national resistance to President Donald Trump.</p>
    <p>In his fourth term, and with a national profile, Brown is unencumbered by re-election concerns. The Democratic governor has never been more popular in California, a state that overwhelmingly rejected Trump’s candidacy, and where just a third of its residents approve of his performance.</p>
    <p>Brown has showed rhetorical flashes, defending Obamacare health insurance this week in Washington and urging the president to “come down from Trump Tower and walk among the people.” Late in December, he was defiant on protecting the environment, vowing that if Trump withdrew from climate change research, “California will launch its own damn satellite.”</p>
    <p>But as Brown’s trip to the nation’s capital this week laid bare, all of the factors that would have made him an ideal adversary to Trump could also be used to, as the Democratic governor put it repeatedly, work to “find common ground.”</p>
    <p>Pure partisan resistance never accurately described Brown, who in a speech last year said that while “ideology and politics stand in the way ... one way or another the roads must be fixed.”</p>
    <p>“I am not going to say, ‘Oh, no, we don’t talk to the president,’ or ‘We don’t talk to Republicans,’ ” Brown told reporters Tuesday after appealing to House Republicans and the Trump administration.</p>
    <p>The meetings, on Capitol Hill and with heads of the Department of Transportation and the Federal Emergency Management Agency, follow a request for nearly $540 million in federal disaster relief for winter storm damage, and for reconsideration of a nearly $650 million grant to electrify Caltrain, a stalled rail project to shuttle riders between Silicon Valley and San Francisco.</p>
    <p>Brown identified infrastructure as an area where “we can all work together” in his State of the State address in January, in which he also pledged to protect the state’s interests on immigration, health care and climate change. Last month, his administration submitted an initial list of infrastructure projects for Trump’s consideration representing more than $100 billion in spending.</p>
    <p>Among the governor’s priorities, including several with their own revenue streams, are creating an express lane network he says will relieve Bay Area congestion, extending BART to San Jose, raising Folsom Dam to improve flood protection, building a hydroelectric energy storage facility in Riverside County and purifying Los Angeles water now being discharged to the ocean in order to recharge groundwater basins.</p>
    <p>Even as other governors harbor doubts, Brown on several occasions cited Trump’s calls for a separate infrastructure program totaling $1 trillion, with some coming from tax credits and public-private partnerships. Brown said he continues to refine his list based on the feedback he’s been receiving, including from his meetings in Washington with the administration and the state’s Democratic and Republican delegations.</p>
